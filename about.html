                                            Encapsulating one's aspirations and interests in a short paragraph is not any easy task. There are many dimensions to every individual. We each find our own ways to challenge ourselves and bring meaning to our lives as well as those around us. This page provides a look into a few of the most significant things that interest me.

                                            As a software engineer I’ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects from concept to implementation. I've gained solid full stack database experience during my career, but recently have found myself gravitating towards front end development.  The quickly evolving landscape and the vast choice of tools and technologies is the recipe for exciting project work.  I enjoy problem solving and am driven to take on side projects and learning in order to satisfy my creative curiosity.  My GitHub projects are an extension of that interest as in my technology study group.

                                            The travel bug took root when I was very young. I didn’t have the opportunity to travel abroad growing up, but I was fascinated by me experiences traveling across the United States and imagined places I wanted to visit overseas.  My career has afforded me the opportunity and my passion for travel has taken me to fifty-one countries on six continents.  The experiences I’ve had, the friends I’ve made and perspective I’ve gained is priceless to me. There’s a lot more I plan to explore.

                                        <div class="SectionTitleSmall">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</div>

                                        <p>
                                            My Brazilian Jiu Jitsu journey started as a way to stay in shape, but has become one of my favorite activities and a way of life. BJJ is a grappling art that can best be described as human chess. It is physical, technical and challenging at every turn.  Becoming proficient requires persistence and the willingness to share with and learn from your training partners.  All aspects of this sport appeal to me and the friendships and experiences I’ve enjoyed have greatly enhanced my life.
