                                            Encapsulating one's interests and aspirations in a paragraph is not any easy task. There are many dimensions to every individual. We each find our own ways to challenge ourselves and bring meaning to our lives as well as those around us. This page provides a glimple into a few of the most significant things that interest me.

                                            As a software engineer I’ve had the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects from concept to implementation. I've gained solid full stack experience during my career, but in my most recent roll I've found myself gravitating towards front-end development.  The quickly evolving landscape and the vast choice of tools and technologies is a recipe for exciting project work.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div>
                                        <div class="SectionTitleSmall">Travel</div>
                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            The travel bug took hold when I was very young. I didn’t have the opportunity to travel abroad growing up, but I was fascinated by my experiences traveling across the United States and imagined places I wanted to visit overseas.  My career has afforded me the opportunity and my passion for travel has taken me to fifty-five countries on six continents.  There’s a lot more I plan to explore.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                    <div>
                                        <div class="SectionTitleSmall">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</div>
                                        <hr>
                                        <p>
                                            My Brazilian Jiu Jitsu hobby started as a fun way to stay in shape, but it has become an important part of my life. BJJ is a grappling art that can best be described as human chess. It is physical, technical and challenging at every turn.  Becoming proficient requires persistence and the willingness to share with and learn from your training partners.  All aspects of this sport appeal to me and the friendships and experiences I’ve had have greatly enhanced my life.
